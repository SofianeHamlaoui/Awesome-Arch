[Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) Arch Linux is an independently developed, x86-64 general-purpose [GNU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU)/Linux distribution that strives to provide the latest stable versions of most software by following a rolling-release model. The default installation is a minimal base system, configured by the user to only add what is purposely required.
